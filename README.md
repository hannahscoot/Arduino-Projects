# Arduino-Projects
 
This is somewhat a contents page - the layout is as follows:

- First this repository is broken down into two parts, either the code is developed for the [Arduino Uno R3][uno-r3] or the [ESP32 Devkit v1][esp32].
- Each individual project is then located in a separate folder, located within its implimented hardware folder.

[uno-r3]: https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-uno-rev3
[esp32]: https://www.espressif.com/en/products/devkits/esp32-devkitc/overview
